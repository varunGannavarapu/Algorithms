# Algorithms

The following repository details implementations of basic data structures commonly used within the Java language. In addition, interpretations of said structures are available in the C programming language. Each implementation includes a description that also details what theoretical runtime should be for each implementation. Each algorithm has been derived as per the book Algorithms 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne of Princeton University.

For each algorithm, an additional README file explaining the general approach taken for each algorithm is given.
