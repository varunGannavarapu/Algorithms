# Algorithms

The following repository is meant to serve as an introduction to commonly used data structures and algorithms. Based off the book *Algorithms 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne*, each topic discussed is based of information explained in said book. The structure of this repository divides content into subcategories based on type. For each individual topic, a README file is present to explain how each individual data structure/algorithm works, with some graphical examples. In addition, there is code available in multiple languages to help users see how they might be used in practice.

Below is a list of topics discussed. It is recommended that users follow along in the manner listed below, as some of the later topics do build upon earlier topics. It is assumed that those who reference this understand basic variable types and how to store information in arrays.
