##UNION FIND

Union-Find is an interpretation of disjoint sets. That is, we intend to take a series of sets, and try to merge them to get as close to a line as possible. The overarching principle is that we have parents pointing to children, that allows us to quickly traverse through sets and find elements as fast as possible.
