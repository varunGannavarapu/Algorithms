# Stacks
Stacks are a data structure that intends to store information in a FILO manner, that is first-in, last-out. The manner in which this is done, is that we take individual items, and *push* them into our strucutre, such that new items will sit on top of old items. To remove items, we *pop* them, meaning that whatever is on top will be returned.
